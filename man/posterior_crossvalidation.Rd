\title{Leave-one-out crossvalidation for \code{graph_lme} models assuming observations at
the vertices of metric graphs,
for WM2 alpha=2 requries observations at nodes}
\usage{
posterior_crossvalidation(object, factor = 1, tibble = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A fitted model using the \code{graph_lme()} function or a named list of fitted objects using the \code{graph_lme()} function.}

\item{factor}{Which factor to multiply the scores. The default is 1.}

\item{tibble}{Return the scores as a \code{tidyr::tibble()}}
}
\value{
Vector with the posterior expectations and variances as well as
mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared errors (RMSE), and three
negatively oriented proper scoring rules: log-score, CRPS, and scaled
CRPS.
