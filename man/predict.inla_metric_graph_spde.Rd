\arguments{
\item{object}{An \code{inla_metric_graph_spde} object built with the \code{graph_spde()}
function.}

\item{cmp}{The 'inlabru' component used to fit the model.}

\item{bru_fit}{A fitted model using 'inlabru' or 'INLA'.}

\item{data}{A data.frame of covariates needed for the prediction. The
locations must be normalized PtE.}

\item{formula}{A formula where the right hand side defines an R expression to
evaluate for each generated sample. If NULL, the latent and hyperparameter
states are returned as named list elements. See Details for more information.}

\item{data_coords}{It decides which coordinate system to use. If \code{PtE}, the
user must provide the locations as a data frame with the first column being
the edge number and the second column as the distance on edge, otherwise if
\code{euclidean}, the user must provide a data frame with the first column being
the \code{x} Euclidean coordinates and the second column being the \code{y} Euclidean
coordinates.}

\item{normalized}{if \code{TRUE}, then the distances in distance on edge are
assumed to be normalized to (0,1). Default TRUE. Will not be
used if \code{data_coords} is \code{euclidean}.}

\item{n.samples}{Integer setting the number of samples to draw in order to
calculate the posterior statistics. The default is rather low but provides a
quick approximate result.}

\item{seed}{Random number generator seed passed on to \code{inla.posterior.sample()}}

\item{probs}{A numeric vector of probabilities with values in the standard
unit interval to be passed to stats::quantile}

\item{return_original_order}{Should the predictions be returned in the
original order?}

\item{num.threads}{Specification of desired number of threads for parallel
computations. Default NULL, leaves it up to 'INLA'. When seed != 0, overridden to "1:1"}

\item{include}{Character vector of component labels that are needed by the
predictor expression; Default: NULL (include all components that are not
explicitly excluded)}

\item{exclude}{Character vector of component labels that are not used by the
predictor expression. The exclusion list is applied to the list as determined
by the include parameter; Default: NULL (do not remove any components from
the inclusion list)}

\item{drop}{logical; If keep=FALSE, data is a SpatialDataFrame, and the
prediciton summary has the same number of rows as data, then the output is a
SpatialDataFrame object. Default FALSE.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed on to \code{inla.posterior.sample()}.}
}
\value{
A list with predictions.
