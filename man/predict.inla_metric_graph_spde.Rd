\arguments{
\item{object}{An \code{inla_metric_graph_spde} object built with the \code{graph_spde()} function.}

\item{cmp}{The \code{inlabru} component used to fit the model.}

\item{bru_fit}{A fitted model using \code{inlabru} or \code{inla}.}

\item{data}{A data.frame of covariates needed for the prediction. The locations must be normalized PtE.}

\item{formula}{A formula where the right hand side defines an R expression to evaluate for each generated sample. If NULL, the latent and hyperparameter states are returned as named list elements. See Details for more information.}

\item{data_coords}{It decides which coordinate system to use. If \code{PtE}, the user must provide the locations
as a data frame with the first column being the edge number and
the second column as the distance on edge, otherwise if \code{euclidean}, the user must provide
a data frame with the first column being the \code{x} Euclidean coordinates and the second column
being the \code{y} Euclidean coordinates.}

\item{normalized}{if \code{TRUE}, then the distances in distance on edge are assumed to be normalized to (0,1). Default TRUE. Will not be
used if \code{data_coords} is \code{euclidean}.}

\item{n.samples}{Integer setting the number of samples to draw in order to calculate the posterior statistics. The default is rather low but provides a quick approximate result.}

\item{seed}{Random number generator seed passed on to inla.posterior.sample}

\item{probs}{A numeric vector of probabilities with values in \link{0,1} passed to stats::quantile}

\item{num.threads}{Specification of desired number of threads for parallel computations. Default NULL, leaves it up to INLA. When seed != 0, overridden to "1:1"}

\item{include}{Character vector of component labels that are needed by the predictor expression; Default: NULL (include all components that are not explicitly excluded)}

\item{exclude}{Character vector of component labels that are not used by the predictor expression. The exclusion list is applied to the list as determined by the include parameter; Default: NULL (do not remove any components from the inclusion list)}

\item{drop}{logical; If keep=FALSE, data is a SpatialDataFrame, and the prediciton summary has the same number of rows as data, then the output is a SpatialDataFrame object. Default FALSE.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed on to inla.posterior.sample}
}
\value{
A list with predictions.
