# MetricGraph (development version)
* Added an INLA implementation for `alpha=2`.
* Added a vignette for handling multiple likelihoods in `R-INLA` and `inlabru`, and updated the `graph_spde_data()` function for such cases.
* Added an INLA implementation for directional models.
* Added support for directional edge weights.
* Added support for creating metric graphs from `SSN`, `osmdata_sp` and `osmdata_sf` objects. In such cases, if available, edge weights and data will be automatically added to the graph.
* Now if one creates the metric graph from `SpatialLinesDataFrame`, `LINESTRING`, `MULTILINESTRING`, etc., if the object contain edge data, they will be automatically added as edge weights.
* Added an option to not perform merges (which is now the default), that makes the graph creation faster and using less memory.
* Added vignettes with a river example and with an example of directional models.
* Updated the vignettes to account for the additions.
* `prune_vertices` now has an option to avoid creating circles when pruning.
* Several updates and quality of life improvements for building very large graphs faster.
* Added the `export()` method, that allows one to export a MetricGraph object as an `sf`, `sp` or `SSN2` object.
* Added wrappers for `leaflet` and `mapview` as methods.
* Added `get_edges()` and `get_vertices()` methods were created, that return the edges and vertices, respectively, in either 'sf', 'sp' or the internal formats.
* Added an option `format` to the `get_data()` method that allows one to also return the data in `sf` or `sp` formats.

# MetricGraph 1.3.0
* Handlers were added in `add_observations()` for situations where observations are projected at the same location, specifically for the `duplicated_strategy` argument.
* A `simulate` method was added for `graph_lme` objects.
* The possibility of fixing parameters during estimation was added.
* The `Spoints` argument in `add_observations()` has been deprecated. Now, `SpatialPointsDataFrame` can be added directly in the `data` argument.
* `sf` objects containing data can also be directly added using the `add_observations()` method in the `data` argument.
* The option of using a `graph_lme` object to provide starting values when fitting a model using `graph_lme()` was added.
* The option of fitting a directional Whittle-Mat√©rn model with `alpha=1` when using `graph_lme()` was added.
* The `kirchhoff_weights` argument was added to obtain weights for Kirchhoff vertex conditions from `edge_weights`.
* Handling of edge weights was improved. For example, if pruning changes any edge weight, a warning will be given.
* The `edgeweight_to_data()` method was added to turn edge weights into data in the internal metric graph format.
* `edge_weight` and `edge_width_weight` were added to the `plot()` method so that plots on metric graphs can be produced with the weights providing colors to the edges, and also with (possibly different) weights providing the thickness of the edges.
* `edge_weights` were added to `graph_components` so that the connected components will have the correct corresponding edge weights.
* `edge_weight` and `edge_width_weight` were added to the `plot_function()` method, where they work in a similar manner to their counterparts for the `plot()` method. The difference is that the weights are plotted as piecewise constant functions.
* The `prune_vertices` now has an option to not prune vertices whose edges have incompatible edge weights.
* The `plot` method has an `interactive` argument that returns the 2D plot as a plotly object, which is interactive when using `ggplotly`.
* The dependency on the `viridis` package has been removed.

# MetricGraph 1.2.0
* Changed argument `data` to `newdata` in `predict` methods. The argument `data` was deprecated.
* Bugfixes on sample_spde and when adding observations based on Euclidean positions.
* Added options `vertex_unit` and `length_unit` on graph creations. Units are given in edge lengths with the `get_edge_lengths()` method.
* Added a method to check if the graph is a tree.
* The graph construction was thoroughly refactored. The resulting construction is faster and cleaner.
* The graph constructions now accepts list of coordinates (where the coordinates are given as either matrices or data frames), `SpatialLines`, `SpatialLinesDataFrames` or `MULTILINESTRING`.
* Adding two options (`sf` package or `sp` package) for handling `longlat` by using the `which_longlat` option.
* Adding `crs` (if using `sf`) and `proj4string` (if using `sp`) for handling general coordinate reference systems.
* Moving `data` to the `private` environment.
* Several data manipulation helper tools and methods were introduced, together with a vignette with a brief tutorial on these tools.
* The method `mesh_A()` has been deprecated, use `fem_basis()` instead.
* Several quality of life improvements.
* Improved the `plot()` method with the option `plotly=TRUE`.
* Improved the `plot_function()` method to accept `data` and `newdata`.
* Included a `process_data()` method for metric graphs
* Renamed the data internal structure from "__group", "__edge_number", "__distance_on_edge", "__coord_x", "__coord_y" to ".group", ".edge_number", ".distance_on_edge", ".coord_x" and ".coord_y".
* Added an "advanced grouping" option, in which the group variable can be a combination of several columns.
* Improved graph_lme() behavior to avoid having NaN as std.errors.
* Added check for distance consistency and, more generally, check to see if the graph has euclidean edges.
* Added method `get_groups()` to get the unique groups, and also to retrieve the columns that were used to create the group variable.
* Added the `get_data()` method to get the data in a user-friendly manner.
* Added `glance()` and `augment()` methods for `graph_lme()` objects.
* Added `get_vertices_incomp_dir()` method to return vertices with incompatible directions.
* Added `print()`, `summary()`, `compute_characteristics()`, `check_euclidean()`, `check_distance_consistency()` methods.
* Added support for edge weights.
* Created `vertices` element in the metric graph object, containing information such as degrees, indegrees, outdegrees.
* Created `print` methods for `edges`, `vertices`, and for their entries.
* Added the `improve_plot` option on `plot_function`.
* Added support for discontinuous meshes (at the vertices).
* Added support for discontinuous functions (at the vertices) for `plot_function()`.
