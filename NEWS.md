# rSPDE (development version)
* Adding a new parameterization (variance and a range-like parameter)
* Posterior sampling on the predict method.
* Added the `cross_validation` function which has several scoring rules implemented (MSE, CRPS, SCRPS, DSS) based on our `inlabru` implementation of the rational SPDE approach.

# rSPDE 2.1.0
* Expanded the parameterization options on matern.operators and spde.matern.operators, along with their associated functions.
* Implementation of the precision method for inla_rspde objects.
* Implementation of the covariance-based spde.matern.operators function and its associated functions.
* Adjusts on the compatibility with the forthcoming MetricGraph package.

# rSPDE 2.0.0
* Added cgeneric versions of the nonstationary models
* Added support for metric graphs (depends on the MetricGraph package)
* Added cgeneric versions of the stationary models
* Replaced rgeneric models by their cgeneric counterparts
* Added a new parameterization (range and std. dev)
* Created a new method gg_df to help posterior plotting in ggplot2

# rSPDE 1.2.0
